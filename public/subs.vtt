aaaaaaaaaa

00:10.000 --> 19:34.392
bbbbbbbbb

20:20.000 --> 01:34.392
ccccccccc

01:35.392 --> 01:37.392
AI Translated

01:37.416 --> 01:39.541
Almost there, just an easy little hawk.

01:40.458 --> 01:41.458
Kind of.

01:46.416 --> 01:48.375
Hey, you wanted to come this time.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.250
Just a little fire.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.750
Hey, hey, ow.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
You hear anything?

02:31.166 --> 02:32.791
I don't like it.

02:33.333 --> 02:36.625
There's gotta be other
people out here, other villages.

02:37.833 --> 02:41.250
And one day someone's gonna end certain.

02:43.708 --> 02:48.250
Never change.

03:31.208 --> 03:37.625
Hey, hey, sweet beautiful chicken.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.500
What are you waiting for?

03:43.875 --> 03:45.000
Let's go home.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.791
I can't wait till I retire.

06:31.708 --> 06:38.707
You're bruised.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.625
You're in my face.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.291
I don't love anything.

06:50.666 --> 06:52.833
How could I beat this chicken?

06:53.333 --> 06:54.333
New look.

06:54.375 --> 06:55.375
Yep, even better.

06:55.625 --> 06:56.625
Oh, look.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.125
The name is Boo.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.250
Hi, kid.

07:00.625 --> 07:01.250
You can do it.

07:01.541 --> 07:01.916
Hold on.

07:02.166 --> 07:02.666
Lay it on me.

07:02.667 --> 07:05.041
I mean, it takes a
bit to rotate the sails.

07:05.416 --> 07:05.750
Got it.

07:05.750 --> 07:06.750
No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.999
It's called a hair whip.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.291
A hair whip.

07:13.791 --> 07:15.083
Let it from those guys.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.583
So, how did go this time?

07:20.375 --> 07:21.583
You found something.

07:22.041 --> 07:25.375
It was in a clearing,
which I found a little help from.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.458
Hey, but this isn't from our village.

07:28.833 --> 07:31.875
I don't even know what
it's made of, but it's proof.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.458
There are other people out there.

07:35.916 --> 07:40.333
I don't know why we haven't
found them yet, but Dad, that island,

07:41.458 --> 07:43.708
I think that's where they're going to be.

07:44.416 --> 07:47.250
I just have to figure
out how to find those stars.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Little fish!

07:53.041 --> 07:54.041
Little fish!

07:55.958 --> 07:58.958
I thought you were gone forever.

07:59.375 --> 08:02.500
It was three days,
but I missed you every...

08:02.666 --> 08:03.416
Mr. Baby.

08:03.666 --> 08:04.166
Bring you?

08:04.541 --> 08:06.083
You said you'd bring me a present.

08:06.625 --> 08:06.875
Hmm.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.833
Well, let me see.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Whoa.

08:12.708 --> 08:13.708
What's it do?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
What's it not?

08:17.083 --> 08:18.291
Where are we going?

08:27.000 --> 08:33.083
This is the place of our ancestors,
where I learned our people are voyagers.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.500
Where Grandma showed me who we are.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.457
She said to Grandma
by the ear and tell him,

08:41.458 --> 08:43.416
I am a one and I'm a two-newie.

08:43.708 --> 08:47.083
You'll board my boat and
restore the heart of the fishy.

08:47.916 --> 08:48.375
Pretty good.

08:48.666 --> 08:49.666
Yeah.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.375
How much did it take?

08:52.541 --> 08:53.166
A few weeks.

08:53.458 --> 08:53.708
Weeks?

08:54.208 --> 08:56.000
That's longer than forever.

08:56.583 --> 08:59.666
I know, but it was important.

09:00.208 --> 09:04.291
And if I hadn't fallen, I
never would have become a wayfinder.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.625
Like our ancient chiefs, like
the last great navigator, Taotai Busa.

09:11.875 --> 09:15.750
Before Maui stole
Timothy's heart and we stopped voyaging,

09:16.708 --> 09:22.708
Taotai Busa wanted to connect our island
to all the people of the entire ocean.

09:23.416 --> 09:30.166
Because together, what we can
do, how far we all can go, it's endless.

09:31.000 --> 09:38.041
And now that I'm a wayfinder,
it's my job to continue what he started.

09:38.916 --> 09:42.416
And this, this is my first cool how.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.500
You should make Maui
go so you can stay with me.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.333
Well, Maui's out
demigodding, but if he ever shows up,

09:51.583 --> 09:54.166
you'll grab him by
the ear and tell him that.

10:32.000 --> 10:38.541
I'm not here to cause trouble, just
a super chiseled demigodd passing through.

10:39.041 --> 10:43.125
Now open the portal to
the island and I'll be on my way.

10:45.333 --> 10:48.375
And why would I risk
breaking the rules for you

10:49.000 --> 10:52.416
when you've already
caused my boss so much trouble?

10:52.958 --> 10:53.166
Who?

10:53.333 --> 10:54.291
Maui started it.

10:54.292 --> 10:55.541
And you'll finish it?

10:56.166 --> 10:59.000
Team up with your precious human again.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.875
Team? You mean the girl with
the canoe and that goofy little chicken?

11:05.500 --> 11:08.625
We weren't a team. I
just used her to get my hook.

11:10.125 --> 11:10.333
Ow!

11:11.125 --> 11:13.999
Nalo is a god, Maui.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.041
If you try to reconnect the
people of the ocean, he will destroy you.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.166
And then he'll destroy her too.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.458
This is between him and me.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.083
Moana has nothing to do with it.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.333
Ooh, you've made her a way by now, Maui.

11:31.833 --> 11:36.583
So now, she has everything to do with it.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
It's done!

11:51.291 --> 11:52.999
I'd like a sound like that.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Woo hoot!

11:58.375 --> 12:06.375
Here you are.

12:13.083 --> 12:19.500
Well, eat up.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.583
We don't want the port getting old.

12:24.916 --> 12:26.000
Why don't you watch me now?

12:26.833 --> 12:27.833
Wanna.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.333
Tonight isn't just a feast.

12:32.916 --> 12:33.916
Long ago,

12:34.208 --> 12:37.333
there was a title given
to the last great wayfinder.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.541
With dreams as big as yours.

12:40.666 --> 12:41.916
The sacred title.

12:42.458 --> 12:43.458
More than a chief.

12:44.291 --> 12:45.291
A tall tide.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Leader.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.833
Connector of the entire sea.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.500
My dear.

12:51.291 --> 12:54.750
Would you honor us
tonight by accepting this title?

12:55.625 --> 12:58.916
How people's first
tall tide in a thousand years.

12:59.916 --> 13:01.040
And show us all

13:01.041 --> 13:03.791
just how far we'll go.

13:25.041 --> 13:28.291
Tonight, we drink
from our ancestors' form.

13:29.125 --> 13:30.916
As tall tide us all once did.

13:31.416 --> 13:33.083
To bestow this title.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
On you.

13:35.625 --> 13:37.208
To connect to our past.

13:37.708 --> 13:38.708
Our present.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.416
And the future that lies beyond.

13:42.916 --> 13:46.000
May the ancestors continue to guide us.

13:54.708 --> 14:00.708
I am
honored to serve our people.

14:03.958 --> 14:06.625
May the ancestors continue to guide us.

14:31.541 --> 14:33.833
One truth may too be ...

14:34.041 --> 14:35.041
...under the stars.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.958
S

15:24.000 --> 15:26.291
You are my people.

15:27.166 --> 15:28.166
So type one.

15:30.125 --> 15:33.916
This is your future
if you cannot find others.

15:35.041 --> 15:39.125
In isolation, this
is how your story ends.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.708
I don't understand.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.291
Returning to
Hichi's heart was the beginning.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.708
You must brave the storm.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.791
Reconnect our people.

15:49.958 --> 15:51.166
Find Mochufetsu.

15:51.666 --> 15:53.958
I don't know how to reach it.

15:54.208 --> 15:57.040
A fire in the sky will guide you.

15:57.041 --> 15:59.916
Wait, I don't even know how far it is.

16:01.166 --> 16:03.166
Farther than I was able to go.

16:06.291 --> 16:07.833
Find Mochufetsu.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.458
Reconnect us all.

16:21.375 --> 16:22.375
Mochufetsu.

16:23.125 --> 16:26.458
The island I have to find is Mochufetsu.

16:27.041 --> 16:28.041
Okay.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.083
Took some searching, but...

16:34.166 --> 16:35.166
Mochufetsu.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
What is it?

16:37.666 --> 16:43.166
An ancient island where the
channels of the ocean once came together,

16:44.000 --> 16:51.666
connecting the people of the
entire sea until it was lost, cursed.

16:53.916 --> 16:59.291
In a terrible storm
of a power-hungry god, novel.

17:02.000 --> 17:08.958
He believed he'd be stronger by separating
the people of the ocean to weaken us,

17:09.708 --> 17:11.458
to end our story.

17:13.458 --> 17:18.583
Our ancestors believed reaching
Mochufetsu would break Nalo's curse,

17:19.416 --> 17:20.416
restore the channels.

17:21.416 --> 17:26.083
It's the only way to
bring our people together again.

17:27.833 --> 17:28.833
Or historians.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.125
We need to convene a council of people.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.208
Fire in the sky.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.750
He wants me to follow it.

18:00.541 --> 18:01.541
Two new stars.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.791
It could take a lifetime.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.791
Don't dive us. I
didn't make it back at all.

18:07.250 --> 18:10.208
It's a call from the ancestors to him.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.416
But if we never see her again...

18:14.333 --> 18:16.500
I do mean everything you want to get.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.166
Sami... No, I mean that's...

18:20.000 --> 18:21.500
I don't want you to leave.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.125
Mom, it's...

18:36.000 --> 18:38.583
It's so fast. What if...

18:40.000 --> 18:41.833
You're a tough time now, Moana.

18:43.291 --> 18:44.458
For some things...

18:46.458 --> 18:47.458
We never feel ready.

21:39.583 --> 21:40.583
My mom.

21:42.791 --> 21:46.125
I'll always be right beside you.

21:46.666 --> 21:50.625
But perhaps you're meant for more.

21:52.625 --> 21:55.500
Oh, what are you so worried about?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.916
It's not like last time.

22:00.166 --> 22:02.958
Last time you
weren't old enough to understand.

22:03.375 --> 22:06.000
Oh, you could lose or learn.

22:07.166 --> 22:11.333
And here we are together
still just a little different.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.666
I can't see where your story leads.

22:17.250 --> 22:20.166
But we never stop choosing who we are.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.250
This is bigger than what you do.

22:28.083 --> 22:29.083
Bigger than us.

22:30.000 --> 22:36.666
So I will sail into this new sky to
reconnect the people of the entire ocean.

22:37.208 --> 22:40.416
And then I will return home.

23:24.791 --> 23:26.458
Moana, you need a crew.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.660
Hey, hey, Apuwa, don't count.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.916
It's the other side of the ocean.

23:31.375 --> 23:32.665
How could I ask them to?

23:32.666 --> 23:36.750
Our people will rise if you let them.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.625
Last time the chicken made it.

23:42.625 --> 23:44.833
Well, I'm going to need a bigger canal.

23:45.916 --> 23:48.124
Yes, brand new.

23:48.125 --> 23:48.333
Sleep.

23:48.666 --> 23:49.291
Double health design.

23:49.292 --> 23:50.625
My fist can do this.

23:51.083 --> 23:51.375
Sweet.

23:51.750 --> 23:52.999
I'm hoping to line
up greats with the crew.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.958
I'd like you on the crew.

23:57.125 --> 23:59.125
Well, we should do better than this.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.790
A farmer on the sea.

24:05.791 --> 24:07.431
We're going to
need to eat more than fish.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
You need irrigation.

24:09.001 --> 24:10.666
Plant propagation.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.625
Take even my best apprentice.

24:13.041 --> 24:14.041
Good stuff.

24:14.708 --> 24:14.916
Exactly.

24:15.375 --> 24:16.000
We need a master.

24:16.333 --> 24:17.333
Yes, you too.

24:17.583 --> 24:18.583
Thanks, Kelly.

24:18.791 --> 24:19.416
You're the best.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.416
I walked onto that one.

24:21.333 --> 24:23.875
Hey, Maui, it's been a while.

24:24.916 --> 24:30.291
I don't know where you are,
but I could really use your help.

24:33.750 --> 24:34.750
Maui!

24:35.458 --> 24:36.458
Oh, Moni.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.625
It's both of us, actually.

24:39.750 --> 24:41.083
Maui and me.

24:42.041 --> 24:43.291
It's part of a series.

24:45.125 --> 24:46.125
Wow.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.541
It's too bad Maui isn't here.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.871
We really need someone
who knows all the old stories.

24:51.375 --> 24:56.333
Someone who's like super
strong and has great hair and just...

24:56.791 --> 24:58.332
I know someone else.

24:58.333 --> 24:59.333
Kind of like that?

25:00.708 --> 25:01.708
Yes!

25:02.000 --> 25:05.625
I'm going with Donna
on a call from the ancestors.

25:06.416 --> 25:07.416
Whoo!

25:07.500 --> 25:10.291
Get ready for some
eyewitness accounts, people.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.916
I'm coming with you.

25:24.625 --> 25:27.041
I'll be back as soon as I can.

25:27.875 --> 25:28.875
I promise.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.458
What if you don't come back?

25:40.208 --> 25:43.791
The ocean is my friend.

25:48.166 --> 25:54.833
Our friend.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.208
He connects us.

26:23.541 --> 26:29.291
So, there is nowhere I could
ever go that I won't be with you.

26:29.625 --> 26:30.625
Go.

26:37.875 --> 26:40.083
So you can take a piece of hold.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.500
Okay, okay, okay.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
One more time.

28:14.916 --> 28:18.541
This is not the end of our story.

28:19.166 --> 28:22.583
This is not where our destiny is denied.

28:23.083 --> 28:25.666
Together, we rise as one.

28:26.416 --> 28:29.166
Together, we take our freedom.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.374
That guy gets it.

28:36.375 --> 28:37.833
Yep, I made you handsome.

28:38.916 --> 28:42.250
Now all you gotta do is catch my hook.

28:43.833 --> 28:44.833
Come on.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.208
Yes, yes.

28:48.666 --> 28:49.458
Come on, you got it.

28:49.666 --> 28:50.866
That's what I'm talking about.

28:51.333 --> 28:52.500
Yes, keep doing it.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
That's it, higher.

28:54.125 --> 28:54.583
We're almost there.

28:54.916 --> 28:55.916
Just a little higher.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.208
Don't worry.

29:14.666 --> 29:16.466
Come on, you know
me, I'll get us out of here.

29:17.958 --> 29:20.125
No, I don't need her to save me.

29:20.916 --> 29:21.916
Again.

29:23.208 --> 29:24.208
Because she'll die.

29:24.875 --> 29:27.166
Melo hates humans
even more than he hates me.

29:27.458 --> 29:28.642
And let me tell you something.

29:28.666 --> 29:29.666
He hates me a lot.

29:30.208 --> 29:33.000
So the farther Curly is
from any of this, the better.

29:33.541 --> 29:36.833
We're on our own.

29:38.708 --> 29:39.958
Yeah, I got it.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.541
I would let you out, but I'm
really hoping to meet your little friend.

29:48.458 --> 29:49.541
I have plans for you both.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.708
Hey, hey, hey, enjoy your lunch.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.500
Melo, what are you doing?

30:18.791 --> 30:20.000
I'm making improvements.

30:20.833 --> 30:21.125
Okay.

30:21.126 --> 30:24.708
Who is perfect as it is?

30:25.083 --> 30:26.083
The fictions of it.

30:26.291 --> 30:29.083
There is only
failing, then learning, then death.

30:31.458 --> 30:33.666
What is the order?

30:34.041 --> 30:35.041
Of course.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.000
That's why you're the wayfinder.

30:38.458 --> 30:39.708
No, no, no.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.208
Guys, the entire
ocean is kind of counting on us.

30:47.416 --> 30:48.000
We've got to rise to the moment.

30:48.001 --> 30:51.750
Stay on course and
kick everyone off the canoe.

30:52.583 --> 30:54.208
Wait, where's the harbor?

30:55.500 --> 30:56.500
Ow.

30:56.875 --> 30:58.041
When will the canoe stop?

30:59.250 --> 30:59.458
Moving.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.791
Well, we're kind of on the ocean.

31:02.958 --> 31:04.082
Oh, Moni.

31:04.083 --> 31:06.000
Lotto, Moni's the other one.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.833
Guys, we'll never make it.

31:10.000 --> 31:10.166
What?

31:10.791 --> 31:12.583
If you don't embrace the ocean.

31:12.916 --> 31:13.934
He kind of breaks the liquid.

31:13.958 --> 31:14.999
Otto, I cannot swim.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.375
You don't use a human.

31:18.958 --> 31:21.040
Now everyone looks sad.

31:21.041 --> 31:23.999
And whoever designs
the canoe, forgot our macros.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.041
Yes, sir.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.291
I am unclear as to what you are doing.

31:34.666 --> 31:38.125
Guys, we want to reach
Motufetu, break Nalo's curse.

31:38.458 --> 31:40.041
We've got to come together.

31:40.583 --> 31:41.958
Find our friends.

31:42.833 --> 31:43.833
I don't use anyone.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.791
Oh, we'll see in the back.

31:46.583 --> 31:47.958
Don't be dead on your feet.

31:48.458 --> 31:49.958
It's time to live your own story.

31:50.250 --> 31:51.500
Even if you disagree.

31:52.083 --> 31:55.333
Try this mandatory look of trials.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.500
What could be better than this?

31:57.875 --> 31:59.165
It would be better than this.

31:59.166 --> 32:00.625
I'm sure it could be so great.

32:01.083 --> 32:02.458
Why, you just need your son.

32:02.958 --> 32:04.375
You can't live here forever.

32:04.625 --> 32:06.041
But it was all the fun.

32:06.458 --> 32:09.125
Don't you know it's
gathers better than you see?

32:10.500 --> 32:11.999
Nothing is better than this.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.583
I'm going to be sick.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.750
Fascinating. It's like an acid.

45:15.708 --> 45:19.000
Can I get a chihu?

45:20.666 --> 45:22.000
Oh, yeah!

45:22.625 --> 45:27.041
Now I just gotta get my baby.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.999
The tattoo, Mommy.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.208
Listen to me. I am a demi-god.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.833
I want to be slept by the tattoo.

45:48.083 --> 45:51.125
Hey! Okay. Rule number one.

45:52.666 --> 45:53.666
Okay.

45:54.291 --> 45:58.291
Roll me back. I'll
roll you back. Not him.

45:59.041 --> 46:02.416
This is what happens
when you meet your heroes.

46:03.125 --> 46:04.583
I know, right?

46:07.208 --> 46:10.000
Rule number one.
You never saw me like this.

46:10.416 --> 46:13.625
Even though I still look very
cool. You look like a kidney stone.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.999
You look like someone
who would know what that is.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Now.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.249
Well, hello, bacon.
Okay. I feel like there's

46:24.250 --> 46:26.583
some back story that
I need to get caught up on.

46:27.041 --> 46:30.458
Actually, you know what? Scratch that.
I don't want to get attached if you all...

46:31.833 --> 46:34.083
You know what?
Which... which... you guys won't.

46:34.333 --> 46:36.374
You're not gonna do that. I
don't even know why I said that.

46:36.375 --> 46:39.375
The point is, there's
some serious god stuff going down.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.250
So I'm gonna go handle my disc.

46:45.125 --> 46:53.125
Alright. Be back in a bit.
Until then, stay alive. Talk to no one.

46:59.083 --> 47:02.375
And if you see a crazy
bat lady, run. She is the worst.

47:02.875 --> 47:04.875
Stay away or you will die. Be good.

47:05.458 --> 47:06.458
Maui, out.

47:08.250 --> 47:10.791
Boat snack. Boat snack.

47:13.416 --> 47:14.416
Where's Moana?

47:22.791 --> 47:24.250
Simia? Simia!

47:24.833 --> 47:27.416
How are you here?

47:28.083 --> 47:33.999
I'm not. You got sucked inside
a giant, um, and her story will end.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.791
Cause now you will never
help the people of the ocean.

47:38.208 --> 47:42.625
And their ancestors will be
like, "Moana, we hate you forever."

48:04.000 --> 48:08.583
You got this.

48:09.250 --> 48:11.916
Here. You got this. You got this.

48:14.583 --> 48:17.708
Relax. I don't bite.

48:18.583 --> 48:19.583
Here come I.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.833
It's been a while
since I've seen a wayfinder.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.791
Love the oar. Would
you like to see me use it?

48:28.125 --> 48:32.000
Ooh, feisty. We
have that in common, Moana.

48:32.041 --> 48:36.875
The human who's got all the gods talking.

48:39.458 --> 48:44.541
Who are you, Matani?
Guardian of this little slice of paradise.

48:46.083 --> 48:49.000
You live here?

48:49.333 --> 48:53.000
No, by choice. Maui never mentioned me.

48:53.666 --> 48:55.999
Probably too busy
playing with his tattoo.

48:56.000 --> 49:00.916
Well, come on then.

49:01.750 --> 49:04.833
Um, I'm not going anywhere with you.

49:05.125 --> 49:08.541
Get out of here, break
Nala's curse, find Motufetsu.

49:09.833 --> 49:12.791
Here to help. You
know the way to Motufetsu?

49:13.000 --> 49:15.875
You think you can only
get somewhere if you know the way?

49:16.416 --> 49:18.833
That's kind of what wave-biting is.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
So much to learn.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.500
A true wayfinder
doesn't know the path at all.

49:29.916 --> 49:34.541
That's the whole point. To find
your way to what's never been found.

49:35.208 --> 49:39.500
If you want to break Nala's curse,
you've got to stop playing and save Sis.

49:39.875 --> 49:40.875
Get a little lost.

49:42.333 --> 49:44.291
Why would I listen to anything you say?

49:45.000 --> 49:47.708
Because Nala trapped me too.

49:49.250 --> 49:53.958
I want you to beat
Nala. Because then, I'll be free.

50:20.000 --> 50:24.875
There's always another
way to get where you need to go.

50:25.750 --> 50:29.875
You just have to
think a little different.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
Different?

50:32.791 --> 50:33.791
Play it right?

50:49.000 --> 50:54.375
Let him save you, then I
know the rules around the bridge.

50:55.833 --> 50:56.916
It's time to get lost.

50:59.208 --> 51:00.541
He's terribly nice.

51:01.208 --> 51:03.166
You know you're questioning.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.125
Take a look around.

51:07.208 --> 51:11.041
I've got to let you up and
down, cause at the end you cannot drown.

51:11.291 --> 51:13.416
In the rain for memories.

51:14.541 --> 51:15.999
It's been too late to see.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.708
And put your trust in me,
because you've got potential and trouble.

51:21.000 --> 51:25.250
The distance are real
existential and lost through existence.

51:25.500 --> 51:28.666
And there is no map beyond estimation.

51:29.416 --> 51:32.500
No explanation,
please hold this equation.

51:37.791 --> 51:40.999
We're gonna get back,
come loose, and lose our way.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.833
There ain't no
time in holding that faith.

51:45.166 --> 51:48.208
You better not try the
thrill of living dangerously.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.583
You've got along a way to go keep crazy.

51:51.875 --> 51:56.208
You'll never know
the rules around the bridge.

51:56.875 --> 51:57.875
What is this?

51:58.791 --> 52:02.875
Don't you know how good you have it?

52:03.625 --> 52:06.375
You're all there stopping you.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.958
You want me, I'm stuck like static.

52:10.375 --> 52:11.375
Can you imagine?

52:12.333 --> 52:14.250
That life is time to carry the nerve.

52:14.458 --> 52:17.500
You've got a chance, don't take it.

52:17.875 --> 52:21.208
I know you're scared, but life's unfair.

52:21.708 --> 52:25.416
It's the truth of
choices making it small.

52:26.541 --> 52:30.166
Trust the fall, and you can have it all.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.208
You gotta come loose and lose your way.

52:35.541 --> 52:38.916
There ain't no
time in holding that faith.

52:39.375 --> 52:41.791
You better not try the
thrill of living dangerously.

52:42.666 --> 52:45.166
You've got along a way to go keep crazy.

52:45.541 --> 52:49.583
You'll never know
the rules around the bridge.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
What is this?

52:54.041 --> 52:56.791
What is this?

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
You're all there.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
There's always another way in my life.

53:02.708 --> 53:03.708
What are you doing to me?

53:07.208 --> 53:08.208
You're all there.

53:29.083 --> 53:30.500
Oh, yeah.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.625
There's always another way.

53:40.375 --> 53:41.375
Order of the guards.

53:42.708 --> 53:45.083
One get you all the way to Motufi 2,

53:45.458 --> 53:47.958
a little short on the
commute for you and your crew.

53:48.791 --> 53:50.291
And Mr. Coconut Oil.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.125
Who's Mr. Coconut Oil?

53:53.000 --> 53:55.500
I've always used my patience.

53:56.416 --> 53:59.500
Do not fear. You have been rescued.

54:00.875 --> 54:03.208
Kwa-ki-na, kwa-ki-na!

54:03.666 --> 54:05.833
We're home, we're home!

54:06.666 --> 54:07.666
Please!

54:15.000 --> 54:16.583
She's opening.

54:29.708 --> 54:31.374
They're such a plan.

54:31.375 --> 54:34.332
They keep you in a snack game
because you want us to go together?"

54:34.333 --> 54:37.208
Well, I certainly did not
keep you for the conversation.

54:37.833 --> 54:38.833
Oh, wait.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.875
Well, shall we?

54:45.541 --> 54:47.083
Do you... can't leave?

54:48.250 --> 54:49.291
Break Nalo's curse.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.833
And maybe one day
we'll see each other again

54:54.083 --> 54:56.958
Remember there's always another way

54:57.458 --> 55:00.541
Even if you have to get lost to find it

55:01.000 --> 55:02.625
Good luck. Hold by one

55:03.625 --> 55:08.790
You got this

55:08.791 --> 55:15.708
Let Nalo find out I
helped will die by lightning

55:15.875 --> 55:16.875
Huh?

55:18.291 --> 55:19.291
Molly looks good

55:22.833 --> 55:25.375
Woah! I'm kissing the pig!

55:26.291 --> 55:28.458
We're in a portal of the gods!

55:29.041 --> 55:29.250
Hey!

55:29.833 --> 55:30.958
Hey guys!

55:31.416 --> 55:32.416
I got her again!

55:32.708 --> 55:33.708
Plus Molly?

55:33.875 --> 55:34.875
Where's Molly?

55:35.541 --> 55:36.208
What's up girlie?

55:36.458 --> 55:37.458
Molly!

55:39.000 --> 55:41.583
You could have told
me we were doing new outfits

55:41.833 --> 55:43.833
But Rocket leaves on
my cheeks for a thousand years

55:43.875 --> 55:45.750
Oh! I can't believe we're here!

55:46.208 --> 55:47.666
Hey buddy, I missed ya!

55:49.833 --> 55:51.749
Oh! Sorry, that was weird

55:51.750 --> 55:52.750
Is that weird?

55:53.333 --> 55:55.125
This is the craziest thing in my life

55:56.833 --> 55:59.582
Love this guy! Not creeping me out at all

55:59.583 --> 56:00.750
Gotta join me for a second

56:01.833 --> 56:03.625
This is cool!

56:03.875 --> 56:05.124
Oh! And did you meet the papa mora?

56:05.125 --> 56:06.290
I thought he'd do this in a climb

56:06.291 --> 56:07.749
But it turned out to be super great

56:07.750 --> 56:10.415
Because otherwise I
never would have met Montagny

56:10.416 --> 56:11.083
Who's great by the way

56:11.083 --> 56:11.833
And now you!

56:11.875 --> 56:13.875
And now we're gonna
bring all of us together

56:14.833 --> 56:16.333
Sorry, you go

56:16.833 --> 56:18.458
You're all gonna die

56:20.833 --> 56:21.833
What?

56:22.916 --> 56:23.083
What?

56:23.250 --> 56:25.708
Nalo didn't just hide Motofetu in a storm

56:25.833 --> 56:27.999
He hid it in a monster storm

56:28.000 --> 56:30.207
In a cursed ocean you can't escape from

56:30.208 --> 56:32.708
And then sunk into the bottom of the sea

56:32.833 --> 56:35.290
Which means a human can't reach it

56:35.291 --> 56:36.999
So unless I break the curse

56:37.000 --> 56:39.124
You just bought a
one way ticket to Densville

56:39.125 --> 56:40.832
Which is why I didn't want
you coming out in the first place

56:40.833 --> 56:43.957
Because now you're
stuck and you're gonna die

56:43.958 --> 56:45.249
Your crew's gonna die

56:45.250 --> 56:47.208
And this time so is the chicken

56:53.833 --> 56:57.040
But it's great to see you

56:57.041 --> 56:58.833
And we're here

57:10.833 --> 57:11.833
And we?

57:13.000 --> 57:16.666
But this place looks perfectly nice

57:17.833 --> 57:18.833
And look!

57:19.416 --> 57:20.416
A constellation!

57:20.750 --> 57:22.125
It's right there!

57:24.583 --> 57:27.207
Guys, the ancestors wouldn't have called

57:27.208 --> 57:28.708
If we couldn't do this

57:28.833 --> 57:30.000
Unless it was a bot dial

57:30.833 --> 57:32.500
That'll make sense in two thousand years

57:32.833 --> 57:34.790
Tell Tybaza said reaching Motofetu

57:34.791 --> 57:37.749
Is the only way to
give our people a future

57:37.750 --> 57:38.791
If you know so much

57:38.875 --> 57:41.000
How come he didn't tell you it was f♪♪♪

57:41.833 --> 57:42.333
Suck

57:42.833 --> 57:46.666
Because he told me to
follow the fire in the sky

57:46.833 --> 57:48.708
That led me straight to you

57:48.833 --> 57:50.625
Which makes sense

57:50.833 --> 57:54.750
Because if Nalo thinks he's
stronger by keeping people apart

57:54.833 --> 57:58.583
Then maybe the way to
break his curse is by coming together

57:58.833 --> 58:02.333
You lift the island and I step on it

58:02.666 --> 58:03.666
Mommy and Moana!

58:03.875 --> 58:04.791
You're doing it again

58:04.833 --> 58:05.833
You're so amazing

58:06.833 --> 58:07.541
This is gonna work

58:07.833 --> 58:08.916
Right? Ocean?

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Ocean?

58:18.541 --> 58:19.541
Moana,

58:20.166 --> 58:21.166
The ocean

58:21.833 --> 58:24.416
Cannot help you here

58:30.250 --> 58:31.250
Grandma!

58:32.833 --> 58:34.083
Actually,

58:34.833 --> 58:36.833
I believe that's a welcome gift

58:39.250 --> 58:39.791
From Nalo

58:39.792 --> 58:47.792
Take that, sucka!

59:01.833 --> 59:04.833
Humans, get your positions,
work together, and let's do this!

59:07.833 --> 59:10.583
We really gotta talk
about your quitting process

59:11.833 --> 59:13.000
Rabs!

59:13.250 --> 59:14.250
Down below

59:14.833 --> 59:16.166
Hate these guys

59:16.833 --> 59:17.957
I'm an elder

59:17.958 --> 59:19.416
And I'm three thousand years old

59:19.833 --> 59:21.500
Which makes me elder, Earl

59:22.833 --> 59:24.832
Just gotta outrun them till sunrise

59:24.833 --> 59:26.500
Oh, I didn't open up

59:26.833 --> 59:27.874
Uh, sure

59:27.875 --> 59:32.833
Oh, yeah!

59:38.833 --> 59:39.916
Woohoo!

59:41.833 --> 59:43.041
Did he just freak out?

59:46.833 --> 59:48.041
Behind us!

59:48.958 --> 59:52.625
If Moana becomes turned
that time to this title, it'll work!

59:55.833 --> 59:56.833
Oh, no!

59:59.833 --> 01:00:00.833
Wait!

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:04.833
Woah!

01:00:05.833 --> 01:00:06.833
Wait!

01:00:08.833 --> 01:00:10.625
Woah!

01:00:10.916 --> 01:00:11.916
Hey, what?

01:00:13.083 --> 01:00:14.083
What?

01:00:15.458 --> 01:00:16.458
No!

01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:20.166
Moana!

01:00:33.208 --> 01:00:37.458
Moana!

01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:45.833
Moana! Moana!

01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:12.000
Well, figure this out

01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:14.416
Yeah, sister Moana

01:01:23.833 --> 01:01:25.790
Don't tell Fazza's!

01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:26.791
I know!

01:01:28.833 --> 01:01:34.250
Uh, uh, uh, it's a
bad time to say I told you so

01:01:34.833 --> 01:01:37.353
So I'm not gonna do that,
because that would make you feel worse

01:01:37.833 --> 01:01:39.290
But I believe in you

01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:40.415
No one else does

01:01:40.416 --> 01:01:42.499
There you go, walk it off, camp

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.791
What? I must be nice!

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:47.708
Ow! No purple, no purple, stop!

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.500
Okay, I'll talk to her

01:01:56.541 --> 01:02:00.083
I know, Maui, it's just...

01:02:03.041 --> 01:02:09.958
Every time I think I know what
I'm supposed to do, everything changes

01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:12.291
I can't...

01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:14.291
Moana almost died!

01:02:14.833 --> 01:02:21.541
If I'm the reason her
people's story just... ends...

01:02:25.583 --> 01:02:26.583
This is serious!

01:02:26.958 --> 01:02:28.250
Is something distracting you?

01:02:28.875 --> 01:02:30.540
Maybe breaking the curses like you said

01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:31.832
We gotta work together

01:02:31.833 --> 01:02:35.958
I pull it from the sea, but
a human has to land on its shores

01:02:38.833 --> 01:02:41.832
Look, I get it

01:02:41.833 --> 01:02:43.249
No one else can do this Look, I get it

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.333
No one likes sucking at their job

01:02:45.833 --> 01:02:47.541
Why are you even here?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.166
Because... because I've been low before

01:02:53.833 --> 01:02:57.500
And I couldn't see a way forward

01:02:58.833 --> 01:03:00.791
And then someone came along

01:03:01.833 --> 01:03:03.125
Someone who I underestimated

01:03:03.833 --> 01:03:06.541
And she lifted me up

01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:10.833
I haven't done anything right

01:03:11.833 --> 01:03:13.166
Since I left behind that topic

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:17.333
Hey, there is a way out

01:03:17.833 --> 01:03:21.250
You wanna get through
it? You just gotta... gee who it?

01:03:21.916 --> 01:03:23.124
You are so bad at this

01:03:23.125 --> 01:03:24.790
I'm the best at this

01:03:24.791 --> 01:03:28.375
I was a human, but now I'm a demigod

01:03:28.833 --> 01:03:30.874
You never know what's next

01:03:30.875 --> 01:03:33.916
I do all those monstrous form?

01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:35.540
Well, you wanna get through it?

01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:36.541
Stop trying

01:03:37.833 --> 01:03:38.791
You're down in the dumps

01:03:38.792 --> 01:03:40.291
You think you're way off your game

01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:43.416
Come on, come on, remember your name

01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:45.124
Don't waste all this energy

01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:48.291
You got the
remedy, and I know your legacy

01:03:48.833 --> 01:03:50.957
You got greatness inside

01:03:50.958 --> 01:03:52.415
And you just gotta believe

01:03:52.416 --> 01:03:53.915
You think you don't have the tricks

01:03:53.916 --> 01:03:55.499
But they're right up your sleeve

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.165
These waters are frightening

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:58.707
But you bring the reckoning

01:03:58.708 --> 01:04:01.249
So drop all the fear and the questioning

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:03.207
I need a... can I get a...

01:04:03.208 --> 01:04:06.082
Who are you? Who are you?

01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:07.666
Who are you gonna be?

01:04:07.958 --> 01:04:09.198
You're gonna... you're gonna...

01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:10.583
You need the history

01:04:10.584 --> 01:04:12.666
You're gonna... you're gonna...

01:04:13.833 --> 01:04:15.875
Who are you? Who are you?

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.249
You gotta... you're gonna...

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:19.750
You need the level up

01:04:19.833 --> 01:04:21.207
For sure, for sure

01:04:21.208 --> 01:04:22.790
You're gonna be nuts and nuts

01:04:22.791 --> 01:04:24.125
You're gonna... you're gonna...

01:04:25.833 --> 01:04:27.499
You're gonna... you're gonna...

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.500
You're gonna be...

01:04:29.541 --> 01:04:34.040
You used to be
that bullying, storm cause,

01:04:34.041 --> 01:04:35.082
conflicting for real

01:04:35.083 --> 01:04:37.832
Can you imagine the
legend is at this point for reals?

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:39.999
You think that it's doomsday

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.374
It's a Tuesday

01:04:41.375 --> 01:04:43.582
You know what, I'm
coming to play, come to play

01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:46.166
And you click right
there for you and I'm trapped

01:04:46.833 --> 01:04:48.207
And I'm gonna impress you and cut you up

01:04:48.208 --> 01:04:49.415
You're gonna come and be a legend

01:04:49.416 --> 01:04:52.999
It's a whole lot of becoming a friend

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.582
But now you got me invested

01:04:54.583 --> 01:04:56.291
I'm gonna use that I call a blessing

01:04:57.833 --> 01:05:00.957
Who are you? Who are you?

01:05:00.958 --> 01:05:02.250
Who are you gonna be?

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.791
You're gonna... you're gonna...

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.250
I'm gonna make some ass do it

01:05:05.875 --> 01:05:08.332
You're gonna fall
on a focus and then spin me

01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:11.333
Pull it up, pull it up

01:05:16.833 --> 01:05:20.290
It's my turn to
give a motivational speech

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:23.249
It's your job to
finally practice what you preach

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:25.082
Because of you, a better me

01:05:25.083 --> 01:05:27.749
I didn't even
think that was a possibility

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:30.082
You copy that a mess after mess

01:05:30.083 --> 01:05:32.999
Then he got into stress,
but now they're also reversed

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.500
You're being put to the desk

01:05:35.833 --> 01:05:38.124
And breaking the curves,
leaving the law, that's gonna be worse

01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:39.749
I'm making the bet
on the breakers and breakers

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:45.166
I've ever met

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.915
I'm gonna make some ass do it

01:05:50.916 --> 01:05:51.541
Who are you? Who are you?

01:05:51.541 --> 01:05:51.666
Who are you?

01:05:51.667 --> 01:05:53.500
I'm gonna make some ass do it

01:05:53.833 --> 01:05:56.583
You're gonna fall
on a focus and then spin me

01:05:56.833 --> 01:05:58.083
Pull it up, pull it up

01:05:58.833 --> 01:06:01.125
You're gonna... you're gonna...

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:02.624
I'm gonna make some ass do it

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.833
You're gonna fall
on a focus and then spin me

01:06:05.875 --> 01:06:07.207
Pull it up, pull it up

01:06:07.208 --> 01:06:08.665
Go get your ass do it

01:06:08.666 --> 01:06:10.082
Come here

01:06:10.083 --> 01:06:12.874
Pull it up, pull it up

01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:14.749
You're gonna fall on your desk do it

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:16.457
You're gonna have to get free up

01:06:16.458 --> 01:06:19.332
Pull it up, pull it up

01:06:19.333 --> 01:06:20.957
Go find your desk do it

01:06:20.958 --> 01:06:21.500
Come here

01:06:21.501 --> 01:06:26.457
Pull it up

01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:31.207
Go get him princess

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:32.625
Still not a princess

01:06:33.833 --> 01:06:34.873
What do you think you are?

01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:44.041
I know what I've asked you is a lot

01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:48.000
That our canoe is in really rough shape

01:06:48.833 --> 01:06:52.833
But I believe that together we...

01:07:13.125 --> 01:07:15.500
We found a way to fix it

01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:17.582
A little help from the ancestors, man

01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:19.582
I did the decorations

01:07:19.583 --> 01:07:21.957
We used the chicken

01:07:21.958 --> 01:07:23.874
Respect

01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:31.249
Nala wants to end our story

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.791
But we're not letting that happen

01:07:31.791 --> 01:07:31.831
We're not letting that happen

01:07:31.832 --> 01:07:33.809
We're not letting that happen We're not letting that happen We're not letting
that happen We're not letting that happen But we're not letting that happen

01:07:33.833 --> 01:07:35.583
We just have to outsmart him

01:07:35.833 --> 01:07:37.915
Find some new
traits he's never seen before

01:07:37.916 --> 01:07:41.666
Well, I have been working on some ideas

01:07:41.833 --> 01:07:44.250
Also, we do have a demigod

01:07:44.833 --> 01:07:46.290
Sure, he's a little scruffy

01:07:46.291 --> 01:07:47.915
But I get out better than nothing

01:07:47.916 --> 01:07:49.082
I think you'll agree

01:07:49.083 --> 01:07:52.916
Okay, we sail to
the heart of Nala's storm

01:07:53.833 --> 01:07:58.166
Once I raise the
island, you all have to get to it

01:07:58.916 --> 01:08:00.833
It would be harder
than anything we faced before

01:08:01.875 --> 01:08:02.916
So if anyone wants to...

01:08:07.291 --> 01:08:11.958
I spent my whole life
learning our people's stories

01:08:12.833 --> 01:08:17.708
Because of you, I get to live for it

01:08:19.541 --> 01:08:20.541
Alright then

01:08:20.833 --> 01:08:23.208
Let's break a curse

01:08:26.833 --> 01:08:30.833
Yeah, been a while since
I pulled an island from the sea

01:08:32.833 --> 01:08:34.153
I know I have to bend it to knees

01:08:34.833 --> 01:08:36.374
I have great posture

01:08:36.375 --> 01:08:40.791
You know what? You farted

01:08:42.833 --> 01:08:44.957
He's growing on me

01:08:44.958 --> 01:08:46.041
Like a witch

01:08:46.833 --> 01:08:47.500
That's beautiful

01:08:47.501 --> 01:08:49.000
Okay, we do this

01:08:49.833 --> 01:08:51.583
We make it home

01:08:52.875 --> 01:08:54.499
Curly

01:08:54.500 --> 01:09:00.833
Is this work?

01:09:01.833 --> 01:09:03.208
I'm doing it one

01:09:20.833 --> 01:09:23.166
Well, now I kind
of miss a lot of monsters

01:09:28.833 --> 01:09:30.500
Ah, it's a big wave

01:09:32.833 --> 01:09:35.415
We can go around it

01:09:35.416 --> 01:09:36.915
Everyone get to your position

01:09:36.916 --> 01:09:39.666
Be ready to switch it up

01:09:39.833 --> 01:09:41.541
Here, it's fucked up

01:09:41.833 --> 01:09:43.458
You might want to check the sundial

01:09:43.833 --> 01:09:44.958
Why? What time is it?

01:09:45.833 --> 01:09:46.833
It's bowie time

01:09:47.833 --> 01:09:52.250
Let's lift an island and
show the swing back who's boss

01:09:52.833 --> 01:09:54.457
Bring the thunder

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:59.833
I mean it's got a foot right?

01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:09.833
Yeah

01:10:15.666 --> 01:10:16.041
Switch it up

01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:16.958
We're going over

01:10:16.959 --> 01:10:18.624
Hold on, I don't want it

01:10:18.625 --> 01:10:26.625
Help me

01:10:29.833 --> 01:10:30.833
Hello

01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:34.458
Hello

01:10:34.833 --> 01:10:36.416
What about this?

01:10:37.416 --> 01:10:40.499
I'm going to pull the finger

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.332
Hold on

01:10:44.333 --> 01:10:45.333
There

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:51.040
Let's do it

01:10:51.041 --> 01:10:55.541
Oh, come on

01:10:57.833 --> 01:10:59.332
They keep coming across

01:10:59.333 --> 01:11:00.333
We got to turn

01:11:05.041 --> 01:11:05.250
Hold on

01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:09.749
Get up Get up

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:11.707
Help me

01:11:11.708 --> 01:11:16.915
Help me

01:11:16.916 --> 01:11:19.499
Hold me

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.915
It's okay, I got a half of them

01:11:21.916 --> 01:11:22.916
More board

01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:26.750
Oh, I'm going to throw this thing

01:11:26.833 --> 01:11:28.458
I'm going to throw this thing

01:11:28.833 --> 01:11:31.790
Well, now it's a cheater

01:11:31.791 --> 01:11:35.458
I am the coward for avoiding

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:37.125
You know

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:40.082
He doesn't care about you

01:11:40.083 --> 01:11:41.750
Oh, he cares about me

01:11:41.833 --> 01:11:42.957
I'm saying

01:11:42.958 --> 01:11:46.250
It's humans, he wants to stop us

01:11:46.833 --> 01:11:48.541
Why are you smiling?

01:11:49.333 --> 01:11:50.416
Because we can use it

01:11:50.833 --> 01:11:52.353
Distract all of, let him come after us

01:11:52.833 --> 01:11:55.915
While Maui reaches the
center and lifts the island

01:11:55.916 --> 01:11:57.249
We switch it up

01:11:57.250 --> 01:12:00.541
Okay, Curly, you
couldn't outmaneuver the storm before

01:12:00.833 --> 01:12:02.073
How are you going to do it now?

01:12:02.333 --> 01:12:04.000
I think I am digging it out

01:12:04.833 --> 01:12:07.208
I will need to chuck the glass

01:12:09.833 --> 01:12:13.500
If you keep coming back to
help us, we'll never break Nolo's curse

01:12:14.833 --> 01:12:17.208
We can draw the storm Maui

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:18.833
It's the only way

01:12:22.833 --> 01:12:28.082
I'm going to throw this thing

01:12:28.083 --> 01:12:29.499
I'm going to throw this thing I'm going
to throw this thing Go as fast as you can

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:33.915
Uh, look, I could
pull up a million islands

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:36.666
But if you're not
there to land on them, then

01:12:40.833 --> 01:12:41.958
See you up there, Maui

01:12:43.833 --> 01:12:45.166
See how they're Moana

01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:49.041
Bacon? Eggs?

01:12:51.833 --> 01:12:52.833
Yeah

01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:55.833
Giant Hawk

01:12:58.916 --> 01:12:59.750
So serious

01:12:59.751 --> 01:13:04.000
See you on the island

01:13:17.833 --> 01:13:19.791
The Spedy thing is coming

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:25.416
Stop placing the protons like this

01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:28.749
Pickle

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:36.750
You can see it!

01:13:39.208 --> 01:13:41.333
I couldn't have done it without Maui

01:14:51.833 --> 01:14:56.458
A little dizzy!

01:14:56.708 --> 01:14:58.750
Lightening and windows...

01:14:59.083 --> 01:15:00.415
solemnizing

01:15:00.416 --> 01:15:05.583
We have been gone.

01:15:05.958 --> 01:15:08.958
You're ready!!!

01:15:10.583 --> 01:15:14.708
I can't talk again.

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:17.083
I'm fine...

01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:19.125
What happened?

01:15:20.833 --> 01:15:21.833
Are we worse?

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:01.375
[whispering,

01:16:01.376 --> 01:16:04.999
