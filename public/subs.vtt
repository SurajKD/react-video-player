aaaaaaaaaa

00:10.000 --> 00:19.392
bbbbbbbbb

00:20.000 --> 01:34.392
ccccccccc

01:35.392 --> 01:37.392
AI Translated

01:37.416 --> 01:39.541
Almost there, just an easy little hawk.

01:40.458 --> 01:41.458
Kind of.

01:46.416 --> 01:48.375
Hey, you wanted to come this time.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.250
Just a little fire.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.750
Hey, hey, ow.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
You hear anything?

02:31.166 --> 02:32.791
I don't like it.

02:33.333 --> 02:36.625
There's gotta be other
people out here, other villages.

02:37.833 --> 02:41.250
And one day someone's gonna end certain.

02:43.708 --> 02:48.250
Never change.

03:31.208 --> 03:37.625
Hey, hey, sweet beautiful chicken.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.500
What are you waiting for?

03:43.875 --> 03:45.000
Let's go home.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.791
I can't wait till I retire.

06:31.708 --> 06:38.707
You're bruised.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.625
You're in my face.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.291
I don't love anything.

06:50.666 --> 06:52.833
How could I beat this chicken?

06:53.333 --> 06:54.333
New look.

06:54.375 --> 06:55.375
Yep, even better.

06:55.625 --> 06:56.625
Oh, look.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.125
The name is Boo.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.250
Hi, kid.

07:00.625 --> 07:01.250
You can do it.

07:01.541 --> 07:01.916
Hold on.

07:02.166 --> 07:02.666
Lay it on me.

07:02.667 --> 07:05.041
I mean, it takes a
bit to rotate the sails.

07:05.416 --> 07:05.750
Got it.

07:05.750 --> 07:06.750
No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.999
It's called a hair whip.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.291
A hair whip.

07:13.791 --> 07:15.083
Let it from those guys.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.583
So, how did go this time?

07:20.375 --> 07:21.583
You found something.

07:22.041 --> 07:25.375
It was in a clearing,
which I found a little help from.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.458
Hey, but this isn't from our village.

07:28.833 --> 07:31.875
I don't even know what
it's made of, but it's proof.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.458
There are other people out there.

07:35.916 --> 07:40.333
I don't know why we haven't
found them yet, but Dad, that island,

07:41.458 --> 07:43.708
I think that's where they're going to be.

07:44.416 --> 07:47.250
I just have to figure
out how to find those stars.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Little fish!

07:53.041 --> 07:54.041
Little fish!

07:55.958 --> 07:58.958
I thought you were gone forever.

07:59.375 --> 08:02.500
It was three days,
but I missed you every...

08:02.666 --> 08:03.416
Mr. Baby.

08:03.666 --> 08:04.166
Bring you?

08:04.541 --> 08:06.083
You said you'd bring me a present.

08:06.625 --> 08:06.875
Hmm.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.833
Well, let me see.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Whoa.

08:12.708 --> 08:13.708
What's it do?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
What's it not?

08:17.083 --> 08:18.291
Where are we going?

08:27.000 --> 08:33.083
This is the place of our ancestors,
where I learned our people are voyagers.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.500
Where Grandma showed me who we are.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.457
She said to Grandma
by the ear and tell him,

08:41.458 --> 08:43.416
I am a one and I'm a two-newie.

08:43.708 --> 08:47.083
You'll board my boat and
restore the heart of the fishy.

08:47.916 --> 08:48.375
Pretty good.

08:48.666 --> 08:49.666
Yeah.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.375
How much did it take?

08:52.541 --> 08:53.166
A few weeks.

08:53.458 --> 08:53.708
Weeks?

08:54.208 --> 08:56.000
That's longer than forever.

08:56.583 --> 08:59.666
I know, but it was important.

09:00.208 --> 09:04.291
And if I hadn't fallen, I
never would have become a wayfinder.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.625
Like our ancient chiefs, like
the last great navigator, Taotai Busa.

09:11.875 --> 09:15.750
Before Maui stole
Timothy's heart and we stopped voyaging,

09:16.708 --> 09:22.708
Taotai Busa wanted to connect our island
to all the people of the entire ocean.

09:23.416 --> 09:30.166
Because together, what we can
do, how far we all can go, it's endless.

09:31.000 --> 09:38.041
And now that I'm a wayfinder,
it's my job to continue what he started.

09:38.916 --> 09:42.416
And this, this is my first cool how.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.500
You should make Maui
go so you can stay with me.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.333
Well, Maui's out
demigodding, but if he ever shows up,

09:51.583 --> 09:54.166
you'll grab him by
the ear and tell him that.

10:32.000 --> 10:38.541
I'm not here to cause trouble, just
a super chiseled demigodd passing through.

10:39.041 --> 10:43.125
Now open the portal to
the island and I'll be on my way.

10:45.333 --> 10:48.375
And why would I risk
breaking the rules for you

10:49.000 --> 10:52.416
when you've already
caused my boss so much trouble?

10:52.958 --> 10:53.166
Who?

10:53.333 --> 10:54.291
Maui started it.

10:54.292 --> 10:55.541
And you'll finish it?

10:56.166 --> 10:59.000
Team up with your precious human again.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.875
Team? You mean the girl with
the canoe and that goofy little chicken?

11:05.500 --> 11:08.625
We weren't a team. I
just used her to get my hook.

11:10.125 --> 11:10.333
Ow!

11:11.125 --> 11:13.999
Nalo is a god, Maui.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.041
If you try to reconnect the
people of the ocean, he will destroy you.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.166
And then he'll destroy her too.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.458
This is between him and me.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.083
Moana has nothing to do with it.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.333
Ooh, you've made her a way by now, Maui.

11:31.833 --> 11:36.583
So now, she has everything to do with it.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
It's done!

11:51.291 --> 11:52.999
I'd like a sound like that.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Woo hoot!

11:58.375 --> 12:06.375
Here you are.

12:13.083 --> 12:19.500
Well, eat up.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.583
We don't want the port getting old.

12:24.916 --> 12:26.000
Why don't you watch me now?

12:26.833 --> 12:27.833
Wanna.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.333
Tonight isn't just a feast.

12:32.916 --> 12:33.916
Long ago,

12:34.208 --> 12:37.333
there was a title given
to the last great wayfinder.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.541
With dreams as big as yours.

12:40.666 --> 12:41.916
The sacred title.

12:42.458 --> 12:43.458
More than a chief.

12:44.291 --> 12:45.291
A tall tide.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Leader.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.833
Connector of the entire sea.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.500
My dear.

12:51.291 --> 12:54.750
Would you honor us
tonight by accepting this title?

12:55.625 --> 12:58.916
How people's first
tall tide in a thousand years.
